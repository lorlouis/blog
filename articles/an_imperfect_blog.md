# An imperfect blog

I have trouble finishing projects, my `Projects/` directory is filled
with half-finished parsers, barely working game engines, three slightly different
versions of a web server and more than a dozen other side projects I started
but never finished. This blog is no exception; I started considering having
my own website two years ago, and in the meantime, the only things I built towards
that goal are:

1. A web server written in C that I gave up on while trying to handle multiple
   connections per thread
2. A few CGI scripts to learn how CGI works (
3. And a barely functioning templating system built around the C preprocessor

As you can see, I made zero progress on **actually** writing a blog. I thought
about it and decided I should start finishing projects more often.


## The average life cycle of a project
```no-hi
      Get a project idea
              ¦ <---------------.
              v                  \
 Try and build the "hard" part    \
        /             \            ¦
   [success]       [failure]       ¦
       v               v          /
Get bored and move   learn more  /
to another project   on the subject

    ??? -> Finished project
```
Whenever I start a new project, I tend to try to build what I consider the
"hardest" part first. This means that when I made a 2.5D "engine" *à la*
Wolfenstein, I only wrote the bare minimum to get to the code that renders a maze.
This meant that I learned a lot about how to write a raycaster, and I even
got it to "pan" the camera up and down. But once I got that working, I completely
lost interest and started a new project to learn about some other concept I
thought was interesting at the time.

## Chasing perfection

Usually, when I work on a project, it is to learn about some concept I
heard of recently. 99% of my projects are never indented to be shared, but it
did not use to be the case. I used to put whatever I was working on, finished
or not, in a public repo on my GitHub. As I learned more, I became critical of
my code. It allowed me to improve my craft considerably, but it came at a cost:
rereading a piece of code a few months after having written, makes me ashamed.

## Getting myself to finish *something*

I don't want to push myself to finish every project I start; otherwise I'll end
up not starting any new projects. I think I should prioritise certain projects,
such as this blog, and get them released.

If you can read this, I managed to get something imperfect out the door.
