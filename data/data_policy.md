# Collecting data

Aside from [the data collected by Linode](https://www.linode.com/legal-privacy/),
I also collect *some data* of my own to get a basic sense of the traffic (or
lack thereof) on this website. I collect a tuple of an IP address and the user
agent, for each page viewed.

This data will be deleted when the logs become too large.
